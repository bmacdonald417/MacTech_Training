## Introduction

For small businesses handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), achieving Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is a critical step in securing government contracts. The Awareness and Training (AT) domain of CMMC is fundamental to building a security-conscious culture and ensuring that all personnel understand their roles and responsibilities in protecting sensitive information. This guide explains how MacTech's "CUI Enclave Required User Training" directly addresses the requirements of controls AT.L2-3.2.1, AT.L2-3.2.2, and AT.L2-3.2.3, providing a streamlined path to compliance for organizations within the APEX Accelerators network and beyond.

## AT.L2-3.2.1: Role-Based Risk Awareness

**Requirement:** Ensure that managers, system administrators, and users of organizational systems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of those systems. [1]

This control emphasizes the need for general security awareness training that is tailored to the risks associated with different roles within an organization. The goal is to influence user behavior and create a baseline understanding of security best practices.

MacTech's "CUI Enclave Required User Training" is designed to meet this requirement by providing comprehensive security awareness instruction. The training covers a wide range of topics, including:

*   Understanding the importance of CUI and the consequences of its mishandling.
*   Recognizing and reporting common security threats, such as phishing and social engineering.
*   Following established security policies and procedures.

By completing this training, all users, managers, and administrators gain the foundational knowledge necessary to identify and mitigate security risks in their daily activities.

## AT.L2-3.2.2: Role-Based Training

**Requirement:** Ensure that personnel are trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities. [2]

While AT.L2-3.2.1 focuses on general awareness, this control requires more specific, role-based training that equips personnel with the knowledge and skills needed to perform their security-related job functions. This could include training for system administrators on secure configuration, or for incident responders on handling security events.

The MacTech Training platform provides the flexibility to create and assign custom training modules tailored to specific roles within your organization. While the "CUI Enclave Required User Training" provides a robust foundation, you can supplement it with your own role-specific training materials to fully satisfy this requirement. This ensures that all personnel, from system administrators to security officers, have the specialized knowledge they need to protect your CUI enclave effectively.

## AT.L2-3.2.3: Insider Threat Awareness

**Requirement:** Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat. [3]

Insider threats, whether malicious or unintentional, pose a significant risk to organizations. This control requires that security awareness training includes content on how to recognize and report potential insider threats. This includes understanding behavioral indicators and knowing the proper channels for reporting concerns.

The "CUI Enclave Required User Training" directly addresses this requirement by incorporating a dedicated module on insider threat awareness. This section of the training teaches users to:

*   Identify potential indicators of insider threats, such as unusual work hours, unexplained wealth, or attempts to access unauthorized information.
*   Understand the procedures for reporting suspected insider threats in a confidential and timely manner.

By educating your workforce on the dangers of insider threats and how to respond, you can significantly reduce your organization's risk profile.

## Conclusion

MacTech's "CUI Enclave Required User Training" provides a comprehensive solution for meeting the core requirements of the CMMC Awareness and Training domain. By leveraging this training, small businesses can efficiently and effectively satisfy controls AT.L2-3.2.1, AT.L2-3.2.2, and AT.L2-3.2.3, building a strong foundation for their CMMC compliance journey. We encourage you to explore the training and the broader capabilities of the MacTech Training platform to accelerate your path to CMMC certification.
