TRIPTYCH 1 (Slides 1–3)
====================================================================

Slide 1 — Welcome to CMMC Level 2 Training
“Welcome. Today is not a check-the-box session.
This is operational readiness.
Every person here is part of the security perimeter.
Not just IT. Not just leadership. Everyone.

In this training, we will do three things:
Understand risk and obligations.
Perform role-specific security duties correctly.
Recognize and report insider-threat indicators early.

If you remember one line today, remember this:
Slow down. Verify. Report.

The difference between a close call and a major incident is often one decision,
made in one moment,
by one person.
Today, we train for that moment.”

Slide 2 — CMMC Level 2: Protecting CUI
“CMMC Level 2 exists to protect Controlled Unclassified Information—CUI.
CUI is sensitive government information.
It is not casual data, and it is never optional to protect.

When CUI is mishandled, trust drops, legal risk rises, and contract value erodes.
So this is not just cybersecurity.
It is business continuity, mission assurance, and customer trust.

Security does not slow business.
Unmanaged risk stops business.
Our standard is clear:
Protect CUI with disciplined behavior, every day.”

Slide 3 — What Assessors Look For
“Assessors do not score intentions. They score evidence.
They look for trained people.
They look for role-based training tied to duties.
They look for insider-threat reporting awareness.
And they look for objective proof:
who trained, what content, which version, and when.

If it is not documented, it is not defensible.
Our goal is not to pass one audit.
Our goal is to operate with repeatable excellence
so an audit simply confirms what is already true.”

Slide 4 — Learning Outcomes and Pass Criteria
“Success in this course means three things:
Pass at eighty percent or higher.
Complete your role module.
Sign your attestation.

If anyone misses threshold, we remediate quickly and close the gap.
This is not punishment.
This is readiness.
When pressure is high, clarity must be higher.
By the end of this training, you should know exactly what to do next,
without guessing.”

Slide 5 — Threat Landscape: What’s Targeting Us
“Most incidents do not begin with advanced hacking.
They begin with exploited trust.

A phishing email.
A fake urgent request.
A reused password.
A rushed click.

The threat stack is real:
social engineering, credential theft, ransomware, exfiltration, insider misuse, and third-party risk.
Attackers need one opening.
We close openings with habits:
Pause.
Verify.
Escalate early.
Slow down. Verify. Report.”

Slide 6 — FCI vs CUI: What Users Must Know
“FCI and CUI are not the same.
FCI is non-public federal contract information.
CUI is sensitive information controlled by law, regulation, or policy.

Here is the practical rule:
If unsure, handle with CUI-level caution and escalate.
Assumptions create incidents.
Escalation prevents them.
Do not guess with sensitive data.
Do not route it through convenience tools.
When uncertain, choose disciplined handling.”

TRIPTYCH 3 (Slides 7–9)
====================================================================

Slide 7 — Acceptable Use and Security Obligations
“Your access is a privilege with obligations.
Authorized use only.
No credential sharing.
Lock screens.
Clean desk.
Least privilege.
Report anomalies immediately.

Your account is your identity trail.
Protect it like a critical asset.
Security is not a department you call later.
It is a behavior you perform now.”

Slide 8 — Passwords, MFA, and Identity Hygiene
“Identity is the front door.
Use strong unique credentials and approved password managers.
Enroll and maintain MFA.
Treat unexpected MFA prompts as suspicious.

Push fatigue attacks succeed when people approve out of frustration.
Do the opposite:
Deny unexpected prompts.
Report immediately.
Follow credential reset guidance.
Small identity habits prevent large incidents.”

Slide 9 — Email, Links, and External Communications
“Email remains a primary attack path.
Verify sender and context.
Hover and inspect links before clicking.
Confirm sensitive requests through a second channel.
Use approved transfer methods.

Urgency is a manipulation tactic.
‘Do this now’ is not verification.
Professionalism is secure execution under pressure.
If unsure, stop and escalate.”

TRIPTYCH 4 (Slides 10–12)
====================================================================

Slide 10 — Device and Endpoint Security Basics
“Every endpoint is a potential entry point.
Patch on schedule.
Keep endpoint protection active.
Use encryption and lock policy.
Avoid unknown removable media.

Remote work does not lower standards.
Public networks do not justify shortcuts.
If a device is lost or stolen, report immediately.
Minutes matter.”

Slide 11 — Data Handling Do’s and Don’ts
“Data has a life cycle:
Create, store, share, retain, dispose.
Secure each stage.

Store in approved locations.
Share with least privilege.
Follow retention policy.
Dispose using approved methods.

Convenience copies become invisible risk.
Ask one question:
If this action is reviewed tomorrow,
will it hold up?
If unclear, escalate before acting.”

Slide 12 — Incident Reporting Fundamentals
“Early reporting changes outcomes.
What counts as an incident?
Suspicious emails, abnormal access, malware indicators, lost devices, policy violations, possible data exposure.

Report facts quickly:
who, what, when, where, how.
Preserve evidence.
Do not self-clean or delete artifacts.
Silence helps attackers.
Speed helps defenders.”

====================================================================
TRIPTYCH 5 (Slides 13–15)
====================================================================

Slide 13 — Why Role-Based Training
“One mission.
Different roles.
Different risk surfaces.

Managers, admins, developers, and business teams make different security decisions.
Training must match assigned duties.
That is how we turn policy into practice.
And that is how we prove readiness with evidence.”

Slide 14 — Role Matrix Overview
“The role matrix is the operational map.
Each role has required modules.
Requirements update when duties change.
Completion is tracked and auditable.

This prevents two failures:
privileged users without role training,
and generic training that misses real duties.
Your role defines your security obligations.”

Slide 15 — Manager Module: Accountability and Escalation
“Managers set control climate.
You own exception discipline.
You monitor behavior risk signals.
You enforce separation of duties.
You escalate concerns fast.

If leaders normalize shortcuts, controls erode.
If leaders model discipline, security becomes culture.
Monitor. Escalate. Enforce.
That is leadership in a CMMC environment.”

====================================================================
CLOSING MONOLOGUE (Optional after Slide 15)
====================================================================

“Security excellence is not built once a year.
It is built in small, correct decisions every day.
When pressure rises, follow process.
When uncertainty appears, escalate early.
We are not aiming for perfection.
We are aiming for discipline, consistency, and defensibility.
One final time:
Slow down. Verify. Report.”
